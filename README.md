# Mousely

A Utility Application made with OpenCV allowing the user to control cursor with head movements and can perform click event using 
blinking of eyes. 

Technology used : OpenCV, Quartz and Dlib 

Blinking of left eye corresponds to Left click event.
Blinking of right eye corresponds to Right click event.
Blinking of both the eyes corresponds to Double click event.

Currently this application is compaitable with OSX only.

# Dependencies Used

1. [Quartz](https://github.com/mayank408/Mousely/edit/master/README.md) : It is used to interact with the operating system and carry out events such as clicking and moving the cursor.

2. [Dlib](http://blog.dlib.net/2014/08/real-time-face-pose-estimation.html) : It is used to detect facial landmarks with high accuracy. Blinking detection in the project is done using this library.

3. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) : It is the Computer vision library which has C/C++, Python, Java interfaces. For this project, I have used OpenCV in Python.
